# Description
Machine learning is an application of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves

# Features
Features are nothing but the independent variables in machine learning models. What is required to be learned in any specific machine learning problem is a set of these features (independent variables), coefficients of these features, and parameters for coming up with appropriate functions or models (also termed hyperparameters). The following represents a few examples of what can be termed as features of machine learning models:
